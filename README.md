Problem Statement:
Consider yourself to be Sam who is a data scientist. He has been approached by
a retail car showroom to help them segregate the cars into different clusters.
Tasks To Be Performed:
1. Building the K-Means clustering algorithm:
a. Start off by extracting the ‘mpg’, ‘disp’ & ‘hp’ columns from the ‘mtcars’
data.frame. Store the result in ‘car_features’
b. Build the K-Means algorithm on top of ‘car_features’. Here, the number
of clusters should be 3
c. Bind the clustering vector to ‘car_features’
d. Extract observations belonging to individual clusters
2. On the same ‘car_features’dataset build a K-Means algorithm, where the
number of clusters is 5
a. Bind the clustering vector to ‘car_features’
b. Extract observations belonging to individual clusters
